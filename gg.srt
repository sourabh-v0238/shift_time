1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:03,293
Tyrion: Why did you come
to King's Landing, Prince Oberyn?

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:05,374
If the Mountain
killed my sister,

3
00:00:05,399 --> 00:00:06,946
your father gave the order.

4
00:00:06,971 --> 00:00:09,572
The Lannisters aren't
the only ones who pay their debts.

5
00:00:10,023 --> 00:00:10,925
Ser Dontos.

6
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:13,547
Once I was a knight.
Now I'm only a fool.

7
00:00:13,572 --> 00:00:15,584
I'm a living fool,
thanks to you.

8
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:18,188
- It's not a good time.
- It's never a good time.

9
00:00:18,213 --> 00:00:19,791
You have your child bride.

10
00:00:19,816 --> 00:00:21,863
If you want me to leave,
just say it.

11
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:27,050
You told me to come at once
if there was anything important.

12
00:00:28,556 --> 00:00:29,628
I'm Jojen Reed.

13
00:00:29,654 --> 00:00:31,536
This is my sister, Lira.

14
00:00:31,561 --> 00:00:33,458
We've come a long way
to find you Brandon.

15
00:00:34,001 --> 00:00:36,102
You're a warg.
It's in your blood.

16
00:00:37,462 --> 00:00:40,266
I don't want you talking to him
anymore, until we get to Castle Black.

17
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:41,497
We're not going to Castle Black.

18
00:00:41,522 --> 00:00:43,503
Bran needs to find
the raven beyond the Wall.

19
00:00:44,556 --> 00:00:48,323
I am the cause for bringing
Melisandre to us.

20
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:50,637
She gave you a son.

21
00:00:52,834 --> 00:00:55,001
I gave you nothing.

22
00:00:55,026 --> 00:00:56,182
That's not true.

23
00:00:56,207 --> 00:00:57,861
I want to see my daughter.

24
00:01:00,853 --> 00:01:02,348
I'm marrying
my eldest son

25
00:01:02,373 --> 00:01:04,601
to a wicked little
bitch from Highgarden.

26
00:01:04,626 --> 00:01:07,656
You don't really plan on staying in
the Kingsguard, do you?

27
00:01:07,915 --> 00:01:09,512
Ser Jaime Lannister.

28
00:01:09,537 --> 00:01:12,311
For a 40-year-old knight
with one hand?

29
00:01:12,336 --> 00:01:13,998
I use my left hand
now, Your Grace.

30
00:01:14,023 --> 00:01:15,461
Makes for more of a contest.

31
00:01:15,486 --> 00:01:16,818
Winterfel's in ruins.

32
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:17,846
What happened up there?

33
00:01:17,847 --> 00:01:20,267
I heard the Greyjoy boys
seized the place.

34
00:01:20,292 --> 00:01:22,815
I sent my bastard
Ramsey to root them out.

35
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,163
Please.

36
00:01:24,321 --> 00:01:25,030
What

37
00:01:25,055 --> 00:01:28,205
is your name?

38
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:30,759
Reek.

Down.

69
00:04:50,495 --> 00:04:52,696
Well done.
You, too.

70
00:04:52,731 --> 00:04:53,448
I only wounded her.

71
00:04:53,473 --> 00:04:55,466
You brought her down.
That's what matters.

72
00:04:55,467 --> 00:04:58,168
A fine shot.
Wasn't it, Reek?

73
00:04:58,203 --> 00:05:00,370
A fine shot, master.
My lady.

74
00:05:00,405 --> 00:05:02,639
Please, my lord.
It hurts.

75
00:05:02,674 --> 00:05:05,275
Oh, sweet.
Don't cry.

76
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:07,611
It will be over soon.

77
00:05:09,414 --> 00:05:11,515
She thinks
she's pretty.

78
00:05:11,549 --> 00:05:13,050
Let me put one
through her face.

79
00:05:13,084 --> 00:05:14,651
We have to reward
the hounds, love.

80
00:05:14,686 --> 00:05:16,520
They did all
the hard work.

81
00:05:16,554 --> 00:05:19,056
Why? I did
whatever you asked.

82
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:20,824
But you made Myranda
feel jealous.

83
00:05:20,859 --> 00:05:23,761
- Me jealous of her?
- <i>My lord, please.</i>

84
00:05:23,795 --> 00:05:26,997
You can see that your presence
has become a bit of a problem.

- ( crying )
- ( dogs snarling, barking )

Rip her!

00:05:35,774 --> 00:05:38,108
Not so pretty now.

90
00:05:50,255 --> 00:05:53,524
Tyrion: <i>Your new hand, it's nicer</i>
<i>than the old one.</i>

91
00:05:53,558 --> 00:05:54,858
Wouldn't you agree, Pod?

92
00:05:54,893 --> 00:05:56,960
Is it solid gold?

93
00:05:56,995 --> 00:05:59,997
Gilded steel.
You're not eating.

94
00:06:00,031 --> 00:06:01,932
Why is no one eating?

95
00:06:01,966 --> 00:06:04,735
My wife wastes away
and my brother starves himself.

96
00:06:04,769 --> 00:06:06,804
- I'm not hungry.
- You lost a hand,

97
00:06:06,838 --> 00:06:09,106
not a stomach.

98
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,941
Try the boar.

99
00:06:10,975 --> 00:06:13,977
Cersei can't get enough
of it since one killed Robert for her.

100
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,247
A toast.

101
00:06:17,282 --> 00:06:20,651
To the proud
Lannister children.

102
00:06:20,685 --> 00:06:23,554
The dwarf, the cripple,
and the mother of madness.

103
00:06:23,588 --> 00:06:25,222
- Oh!
- I'll clean it up.

104
00:06:25,256 --> 00:06:27,257
No, I'll do it.
Leave us.

105
00:06:29,994 --> 00:06:32,396
It's only wine.

106
00:06:41,472 --> 00:06:43,440
I can't fight anymore.

107
00:06:43,474 --> 00:06:45,142
What about your left?

108
00:06:46,611 --> 00:06:49,980
I can hold a sword,
but all my instincts are wrong.

109
00:06:50,014 --> 00:06:52,082
How can I
protect the king

110
00:06:52,116 --> 00:06:53,817
when I can hardly
wipe my own ass?

111
00:06:53,852 --> 00:06:56,453
You're the Lord Commander now.
Command.

112
00:06:56,487 --> 00:06:59,389
Let others
do the fighting.

113
00:06:59,424 --> 00:07:02,593
When was the last time
Father used a sword?

114
00:07:02,627 --> 00:07:05,028
I'm not Father.
I'm the Kingslayer.

115
00:07:05,063 --> 00:07:07,197
When people find out
I can't slay a pigeon...

116
00:07:07,232 --> 00:07:10,467
Train, then.
Learn to fight with your other hand.

117
00:07:10,501 --> 00:07:13,871
With whom? You?
Men talk.

118
00:07:13,905 --> 00:07:16,440
Soon as someone discovers I can't fight,
he'll tell everyone.

119
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:22,012
You need a proper,
discreet swordsman.

120
00:07:22,046 --> 00:07:25,682
As it happens,
I have just the one.

121
00:07:34,425 --> 00:07:37,494
My brother tells me
you can keep your mouth shut.

122
00:07:37,528 --> 00:07:39,463
Unusual talent
for a sellsword.

123
00:07:39,497 --> 00:07:41,665
He tells me
you shit gold

124
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:44,534
just like your father.

125
00:07:44,569 --> 00:07:46,436
Is this place safe?

126
00:07:48,673 --> 00:07:50,974
There's this knight,
Leygood,

127
00:07:51,009 --> 00:07:53,610
- got thunderbolts on his shield.
- Uh-huh.

128
00:07:53,645 --> 00:07:56,146
Right here is where
I fuck his wife.

129
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:58,482
She's a screamer,
that one.

130
00:07:58,516 --> 00:08:01,251
If they don't hear her,
they won't hear us.

131
00:08:02,854 --> 00:08:05,489
( whistles ) I've never seen
Valyrian steel before.

132
00:08:05,523 --> 00:08:07,891
She's a beauty.
The problem is,

133
00:08:07,926 --> 00:08:10,260
if you fight with
an edged blade,

134
00:08:10,295 --> 00:08:12,462
I'll have to.

135
00:08:12,497 --> 00:08:13,931
And if I fight with
an edged blade,

136
00:08:13,965 --> 00:08:16,400
I'll have no one
left to pay me.

137
00:08:16,434 --> 00:08:18,135
( blade clatters )

138
00:08:18,169 --> 00:08:20,537
I haven't used a sparring
sword since I was nine.

139
00:08:25,376 --> 00:08:27,077
Ah!

140
00:08:27,111 --> 00:08:30,414
Bold warrior you are,
attacking a man when his guard's down.

141
00:08:30,448 --> 00:08:32,749
Best time
to attack a man.

142
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,787
Mind yourself.

143
00:08:38,623 --> 00:08:41,191
- If I still had my right hand...
- Plan on growing it back?

144
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,607
Come on, then.

145
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,821
Man:
<i>Open the gates!</i>

146
00:09:12,824 --> 00:09:14,758
<i>Riders coming in!</i>

147
00:09:17,929 --> 00:09:19,696
( horse whinnies )

148
00:09:30,441 --> 00:09:33,243
Man: <i>Let's get these</i>
<i>horses seen to!</i>

149
00:09:35,546 --> 00:09:37,714
Father.
Welcome home.

150
00:09:37,749 --> 00:09:41,852
Walda, this is
Ramsay Snow, my bastard.

151
00:09:41,886 --> 00:09:43,954
A pleasure, Mother.

152
00:09:43,988 --> 00:09:46,023
Hello.

153
00:09:46,057 --> 00:09:48,725
Roose: <i>See that the horses are fed,</i>
<i>watered, and rubbed down.</i>

154
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:52,062
And take Lady Walda
to her chambers.

155
00:09:52,096 --> 00:09:54,131
This way, my lady.

156
00:09:54,165 --> 00:09:56,233
Where is your prize?

157
00:09:56,267 --> 00:09:57,868
With the hounds.

158
00:09:59,237 --> 00:10:01,505
I'll have a look at him.

159
00:10:06,911 --> 00:10:09,146
I hear you took a hand
from the Kingslayer.

160
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,948
Word travels.
How he screamed.

161
00:10:11,983 --> 00:10:14,484
- You would have loved it.
- ( laughs )

162
00:10:23,795 --> 00:10:25,629
Father.

163
00:10:34,138 --> 00:10:35,939
What did you
do to him?

164
00:10:35,973 --> 00:10:37,040
I trained him.

165
00:10:37,065 --> 00:10:40,310
He was a slow learner,
but he learned.

166
00:10:40,311 --> 00:10:42,946
You flayed him.

167
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:45,348
Peeled a few bits.

168
00:10:45,383 --> 00:10:47,317
Removed a few others.

169
00:10:49,854 --> 00:10:52,222
This was Balon Greyjoy's
son and heir.

170
00:10:52,256 --> 00:10:54,658
We've been flaying
our enemies for 1,000 years.

171
00:10:54,692 --> 00:10:56,760
The flayed man
is on our banners.

172
00:10:56,794 --> 00:10:58,628
My banners,
not yours.

173
00:10:58,663 --> 00:11:00,664
You're not a Bolton.
You're a Snow.

174
00:11:04,368 --> 00:11:06,870
Tywin Lannister has given
me the North.

175
00:11:06,904 --> 00:11:09,406
But he won't lift a finger
to help me take it.

176
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,308
As long as the ironborn
hold Moat Cailin,

177
00:11:11,342 --> 00:11:13,543
<i>our armies are trapped</i>
<i>south of the Neck.</i>

178
00:11:13,578 --> 00:11:16,847
Theon was a valuable hostage,
not your plaything.

179
00:11:16,881 --> 00:11:20,317
I wanted to trade him
for Moat Cailin.

180
00:11:20,351 --> 00:11:22,152
I already asked.

181
00:11:22,186 --> 00:11:25,655
Lord Greyjoy refused.
Savages have no--

182
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:28,692
You sent terms to Balon Greyjoy
without my consent?

183
00:11:28,726 --> 00:11:30,794
You made me acting
Lord of the Dreadfort.

184
00:11:30,828 --> 00:11:32,295
I acted.

185
00:11:38,302 --> 00:11:40,937
I had to smuggle myself
into my own lands

186
00:11:40,972 --> 00:11:42,772
thanks to the Greyjoys.

187
00:11:42,807 --> 00:11:44,774
I needed Theon.

188
00:11:44,809 --> 00:11:46,743
I needed him whole.

189
00:11:46,777 --> 00:11:50,247
Theon was our enemy.

190
00:11:50,281 --> 00:11:52,282
But Reek,

191
00:11:52,316 --> 00:11:55,152
Reek will never
betray us.

192
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,889
I placed far too much
trust in you.

193
00:12:07,698 --> 00:12:11,568
Reek, how could you let me stand
before my father unshaven?

194
00:12:11,602 --> 00:12:15,071
- <i>It's disrespectful.</i>
- I'm sorry, my lord.

195
00:12:17,275 --> 00:12:19,376
Give him the razor.

196
00:12:27,218 --> 00:12:30,487
If I'm not a Bolton,
Father, what does it matter?

197
00:12:38,629 --> 00:12:40,163
Go on, Reek.

198
00:12:40,198 --> 00:12:42,632
<i>A nice close shave.</i>

199
00:13:02,887 --> 00:13:06,356
Reek, tell Father

200
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:09,426
where are Bran
and Rickon Stark?

201
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,494
I don't know,
my lord.

202
00:13:11,529 --> 00:13:13,263
You murdered them

203
00:13:13,297 --> 00:13:17,067
and displayed their corpses
at Winterfell.

204
00:13:17,101 --> 00:13:20,537
Ramsay: <i>Reek,</i>

205
00:13:20,571 --> 00:13:22,806
did you murder
the Stark boys?

206
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,008
No, my lord.

207
00:13:25,042 --> 00:13:26,309
Just two farm boys.

208
00:13:26,344 --> 00:13:29,312
Ramsay: <i>And crisped them</i>
<i>so no one would know.</i>

209
00:13:29,347 --> 00:13:31,982
Theon:
<i>Yes, my lord.</i>

210
00:13:33,751 --> 00:13:36,486
The Starks have always
ruled the North.

211
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,189
If Bran and Rickon
are alive,

212
00:13:39,223 --> 00:13:41,791
the country will rally
to their side

213
00:13:41,826 --> 00:13:44,027
now that
Robb Stark is gone.

214
00:13:46,197 --> 00:13:49,065
<i>Oh, that's right, Reek.</i>

215
00:13:50,501 --> 00:13:52,535
Robb Stark is dead.

216
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:55,305
<i>Sorry.</i>

217
00:13:55,339 --> 00:13:57,607
<i>I know he was like</i>
<i>a brother to you.</i>

218
00:13:57,642 --> 00:14:00,577
But my father put a knife
through his heart.

219
00:14:03,881 --> 00:14:06,016
How do you feel
about that?

220
00:14:19,463 --> 00:14:21,898
- You ready for a hunt?
- Always.

221
00:14:21,932 --> 00:14:25,168
Find those boys and I'll give you
1,000 acres and a holdfast.

222
00:14:25,202 --> 00:14:27,237
Your pet rat
have any thoughts

223
00:14:27,271 --> 00:14:29,472
on which way they went
after Winterfell?

224
00:14:31,475 --> 00:14:33,643
Jon Snow is at
Castle Black.

225
00:14:35,079 --> 00:14:37,013
Who the fuck
is Jon Snow?

226
00:14:37,048 --> 00:14:38,415
Their bastard brother.

227
00:14:38,449 --> 00:14:40,717
He could be
sheltering them.

228
00:14:40,751 --> 00:14:42,319
He may know
where they are.

229
00:14:43,954 --> 00:14:47,424
Even if he doesn't,
he's half Stark himself.

230
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:49,092
Could be a threat.

231
00:14:49,126 --> 00:14:51,261
You want to prove
yourself a Bolton?

232
00:14:51,295 --> 00:14:54,864
Gather whatever
men you can and ride for Moat Cailin.

233
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:57,133
Bring this creature
of yours.

234
00:14:58,336 --> 00:15:00,470
Maybe he'll be
of some use.

235
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,908
Take the Moat
for the family,

236
00:15:04,942 --> 00:15:06,609
for <i>our</i> family,

237
00:15:06,644 --> 00:15:09,145
and I'll reconsider
your position.

238
00:15:12,216 --> 00:15:15,685
Lord Varys.
Breakfasting with the king?

239
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,988
I'm afraid foreigners aren't
welcome at such exclusive affairs.

240
00:15:19,023 --> 00:15:21,825
- Oh, to be foreign.
- Ahem.

241
00:15:21,859 --> 00:15:23,993
Shae has been noticed.

242
00:15:24,028 --> 00:15:25,495
Sansa's maid
saw you with her.

243
00:15:25,529 --> 00:15:27,230
She already told
your sister.

244
00:15:27,298 --> 00:15:29,499
It's only a matter of time
before your father hears.

245
00:15:29,533 --> 00:15:32,702
So I'm guilty of being seen with
my own wife's handmaiden.

246
00:15:32,737 --> 00:15:34,504
My father will ask you
if there's anything more

247
00:15:34,538 --> 00:15:36,206
and you'll tell him
some clever lie.

248
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,941
No, I will not.

249
00:15:37,975 --> 00:15:41,244
How long do you imagine
your father and sister would let me live

250
00:15:41,278 --> 00:15:43,613
if they suspected
me of lying?

251
00:15:43,647 --> 00:15:46,049
I have no pet sellsword
to protect me.

252
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:48,118
No legendary brother
to avenge me.

253
00:15:48,152 --> 00:15:50,587
<i>Only little birds</i>
<i>who whisper in my ear.</i>

254
00:15:50,621 --> 00:15:52,389
Forgive me
if I don't weep for you.

255
00:15:52,423 --> 00:15:55,458
No one weeps
for spiders or whores.

256
00:15:55,493 --> 00:15:58,628
I have friends across
the sea who could help her.

257
00:15:58,662 --> 00:16:00,163
She won't leave.

258
00:16:00,197 --> 00:16:01,464
I've told her this is
a dangerous place

259
00:16:01,499 --> 00:16:03,400
so many times,
she no longer believes it.

260
00:16:03,434 --> 00:16:06,403
Your father has promised
to hang the next whore he finds you with.

261
00:16:06,437 --> 00:16:09,973
Have you ever known
your father to make an idle threat?

262
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:15,178
From House Tyrell
and the people of the Reach,

263
00:16:15,212 --> 00:16:19,416
Your Grace, it is my honor to present you
with this wedding cup.

264
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:21,985
May you
and my daughter Margaery

265
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:23,820
drink deep
and live long.

266
00:16:23,854 --> 00:16:26,256
A handsome goblet,
my lord.

267
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:28,925
Or shall I call
you Father?

268
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:31,494
I shall be honored,
Your Grace.

269
00:16:38,836 --> 00:16:41,237
She's the whore
I told you about.

270
00:16:41,272 --> 00:16:43,072
The dark-haired one.

271
00:16:44,775 --> 00:16:47,744
Have her brought to the Tower of the Hand
before the wedding.

272
00:16:58,289 --> 00:16:59,589
A book?

273
00:16:59,623 --> 00:17:02,058
"The Lives of Four Kings."
Grand Maester Kaeth's history

274
00:17:02,092 --> 00:17:04,394
of the reigns of
Daeron the Young Dragon,

275
00:17:04,428 --> 00:17:08,898
Baelor the Blessed, Aegon the Unworthy,
and Daeron the Good.

276
00:17:08,966 --> 00:17:10,633
A book every king
should read.

277
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:21,811
Now that the war is won,

278
00:17:21,846 --> 00:17:25,014
we should all find
time for wisdom.

279
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:28,284
Thank you, Uncle.

280
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:42,565
One of only two Valyrian
steel swords in the capital,

281
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:46,503
Your Grace, freshly
forged in your honor.

282
00:17:59,283 --> 00:18:03,319
Careful, Your Grace.
Nothing cuts like Valyrian steel.

283
00:18:03,354 --> 00:18:05,622
So they say.

284
00:18:13,864 --> 00:18:15,698
( panting )

285
00:18:17,034 --> 00:18:19,235
Such a great sword
should have a name.

286
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:22,071
- What shall I call her?
- Man: <i>Stormbringer.</i>

287
00:18:22,172 --> 00:18:24,240
- Man #2: <i>Terminus.</i>
- Man #3: <i>Widow's Wail.</i>

288
00:18:24,275 --> 00:18:26,776
- Man #4: <i>Wolfsbane.</i>
- Widow's Wail. I like that.

289
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:29,112
( chuckles )

290
00:18:29,146 --> 00:18:31,180
Every time I use it,
it'll be like cutting off

291
00:18:31,215 --> 00:18:32,849
Ned Stark's head
all over again.

292
00:18:54,939 --> 00:18:56,873
<i>( door opens )</i>

293
00:19:01,312 --> 00:19:03,112
Don't.

294
00:19:05,149 --> 00:19:07,183
You want me on the desk?

295
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:12,855
- <i>What's wrong, my lion?</i>
- Don't call me that.

296
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:15,592
What should I call you?

297
00:19:15,626 --> 00:19:18,561
I'm afraid our friendship
can't continue.

298
00:19:18,596 --> 00:19:20,363
Our friendship?

299
00:19:20,397 --> 00:19:22,765
There's a ship waiting in
the harbor bound for Pentos.

300
00:19:23,834 --> 00:19:25,001
What?

301
00:19:25,035 --> 00:19:26,469
You'll have your own
cabin, of course,

302
00:19:26,503 --> 00:19:30,873
and across the Narrow Sea
a house, servants.

303
00:19:32,142 --> 00:19:33,576
What is this?

304
00:19:33,611 --> 00:19:35,812
I'm a married man.

305
00:19:35,846 --> 00:19:38,715
My wife has suffered a great deal,
as you well know.

306
00:19:38,749 --> 00:19:41,884
<i>I don't want her to suffer anymore</i>
<i>on my account.</i>

307
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,087
I need to uphold my vows.

308
00:19:44,121 --> 00:19:46,756
She doesn't want you.

309
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:49,425
- <i>I need to do right by her.</i>
- You don't want her.

310
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,160
By our children.

311
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:55,531
- What are you afraid of?
- I'm not afraid.

312
00:19:55,566 --> 00:19:58,968
You are. You are afraid of
your father and your sister.

313
00:19:59,003 --> 00:20:01,684
- You're going to run from them all your life?
- I need you to leave.

314
00:20:01,705 --> 00:20:04,707
I'm not afraid of them.
I'm not going to run.

315
00:20:04,742 --> 00:20:07,076
- Shae.
- We will fight them together.

316
00:20:07,111 --> 00:20:09,479
It's like you said,
I am yours and you are mine.

317
00:20:09,513 --> 00:20:11,614
You're a whore!

318
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:16,853
Sansa is fit to bear
my children and you are not.

319
00:20:16,887 --> 00:20:19,355
I can't be in love
with a whore.

320
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:21,791
I can't have children
with a whore.

321
00:20:21,825 --> 00:20:24,527
How many men
have you been with?

322
00:20:24,561 --> 00:20:26,796
500? 5,000?

323
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:35,104
How many whores
have you been with?

324
00:20:35,139 --> 00:20:37,273
I have enjoyed my time
with all of them

325
00:20:37,341 --> 00:20:39,409
and I have enjoyed my time
with you most of all.

326
00:20:39,443 --> 00:20:41,744
But now that time
is over.

327
00:20:45,182 --> 00:20:47,617
<i>( Shae crying )</i>

328
00:20:57,494 --> 00:21:00,730
You'll have a comfortable
life in Pentos.

329
00:21:02,733 --> 00:21:05,601
Bronn will escort you
to your ship.

330
00:21:22,886 --> 00:21:25,521
<i>( door closes )</i>

332
00:21:33,597 --> 00:21:36,165
Accept these tokens
of our faith, my lord,

333
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,134
and lead us
from the darkness.

334
00:21:38,168 --> 00:21:39,702
( crying )

335
00:21:39,737 --> 00:21:42,405
Sire, I served you well.

336

<i>( crowd chanting )</i>

Yours are the stars

Tell him!
Tell him!

<i>for the night is dark</i>
<i>and full of terrors.</i>

( screaming )

342
00:22:10,167 --> 00:22:12,635
Did you see?
Their souls.

343
00:22:13,169 --> 00:22:15,604
It was their souls.

344
00:22:15,639 --> 00:22:18,674
Our lord took them.
Did you see?

345
00:22:25,248 --> 00:22:28,250
Lord Florent was
your brother by law.

346
00:22:28,285 --> 00:22:30,552
He was an infidel.

347
00:22:30,587 --> 00:22:33,055
He worshipped the gods
of his fathers

348
00:22:33,089 --> 00:22:35,257
and their fathers
before him.

349
00:22:35,292 --> 00:22:37,926
They were the gods
of your fathers, too.

350
00:22:37,961 --> 00:22:40,262
I ordered him to tear
down his idols.

351
00:22:40,297 --> 00:22:41,730
He disobeyed.

352
00:22:41,765 --> 00:22:44,066
How many ships did he
bring to your cause?

353
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,367
How many men?

354
00:22:45,402 --> 00:22:47,770
A good deal
more than you.

355
00:22:49,205 --> 00:22:51,040
Did you see,
Ser Davos?

356
00:22:51,074 --> 00:22:52,374
They're with
our lord now.

357
00:22:52,409 --> 00:22:54,943
Their sins all burned away.
Did you see?

358
00:22:54,978 --> 00:22:57,646
I'm sure they're more
than grateful, my queen.

359
00:23:09,392 --> 00:23:11,894
( sniffs )

360
00:23:11,928 --> 00:23:13,662
Meat's off.

361
00:23:15,031 --> 00:23:17,399
Our larders
are almost empty.

362
00:23:17,434 --> 00:23:19,468
Serve fish, then.
We're on an island.

363
00:23:19,502 --> 00:23:21,070
You hate fish.

364
00:23:21,104 --> 00:23:23,906
I hate a good many things,
but I suffer them all the same.

365
00:23:25,442 --> 00:23:29,311
When Storm's End
was under siege and I was starving,

366
00:23:29,346 --> 00:23:33,449
<i>Stannis boiled soup</i>
<i>for me from books.</i>

367
00:23:33,483 --> 00:23:36,552
The binding glue
is made from horses.

368
00:23:39,489 --> 00:23:44,126
One morning, he shot two seagulls
on the beach.

369
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:47,830
I've never tasted anything
as good as grilled seagull.

370
00:23:49,065 --> 00:23:51,600
- Do you remember?
- Of course I remember.

371
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:56,839
Have you ever known
true hunger, my lady?

372
00:23:56,873 --> 00:23:59,074
<i>It's all I knew</i>
<i>when I was a child</i>

373
00:23:59,109 --> 00:24:01,276
Until you found
the Lord of Light?

374
00:24:01,311 --> 00:24:03,846
Until he found me.

375
00:24:10,754 --> 00:24:12,988
I fear for
our daughter's soul.

376
00:24:14,691 --> 00:24:16,558
<i>Every mother should fear</i>
<i>for her child's soul.</i>

377
00:24:16,593 --> 00:24:18,727
- She's a stubborn little beast.
- She's a child.

378
00:24:18,762 --> 00:24:20,863
You barely know her.

379
00:24:20,897 --> 00:24:23,766
You think she's sweet
because she smiles when you visit.

380
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,068
She's sullen and stubborn
and sinful.

381
00:24:26,102 --> 00:24:29,138
Why else would the Lord of Light have
seen fit to mark her face?

382
00:24:29,172 --> 00:24:30,672
She needs the rod.

383
00:24:30,707 --> 00:24:34,176
She's my daughter.
You will not strike her.

384
00:24:35,545 --> 00:24:37,246
As you command.

385
00:24:39,315 --> 00:24:41,717
Perhaps the Lady Melisandre
could speak with her.

386
00:24:45,321 --> 00:24:48,023
<i>( knocks )</i>

387
00:24:49,492 --> 00:24:51,126
Come in.

388
00:24:53,296 --> 00:24:55,597
Were you sleeping,
Princess?

389
00:25:00,203 --> 00:25:02,571
Did you watch the ceremony
on the beach?

390
00:25:02,605 --> 00:25:05,007
I heard it.

391
00:25:05,041 --> 00:25:06,642
And it frightened you?

392
00:25:06,676 --> 00:25:08,544
Ser Axel was my uncle.

393
00:25:08,578 --> 00:25:10,846
<i>He was always</i>
<i>kind to me.</i>

394
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,848
They're in a better
place now, Princess.

395
00:25:12,882 --> 00:25:15,717
<i>The fire cleansed them</i>
<i>of the sins of the world.</i>

396
00:25:15,752 --> 00:25:17,352
But they screamed.

397
00:25:17,387 --> 00:25:19,388
Women scream
when they give birth.

398
00:25:19,422 --> 00:25:22,024
Afterward they are
filled with joy.

399
00:25:22,058 --> 00:25:23,725
Afterward they aren't
ash and bone.

400
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,761
You have so many
questions, don't you?

401
00:25:25,795 --> 00:25:27,996
<i>So did I</i>
<i>when I was a child.</i>

402
00:25:28,031 --> 00:25:30,365
I was much like you.

403
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,001
Only I wasn't a princess.

404
00:25:33,036 --> 00:25:34,603
And you didn't have this.

405
00:25:34,637 --> 00:25:36,505
No.

406
00:25:36,539 --> 00:25:39,441
But I suffered in other ways,
sweet girl, believe me.

407
00:25:39,476 --> 00:25:41,877
What do you know
of the gods?

408
00:25:41,911 --> 00:25:44,179
I read
"The Seven-Pointed Star."

409
00:25:44,214 --> 00:25:46,982
Lies and fables.

410
00:25:47,016 --> 00:25:50,052
Septons speak
of seven gods.

411
00:25:50,086 --> 00:25:51,653
There are but two--

412
00:25:51,688 --> 00:25:54,056
a god of light
and love and joy

413
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:57,726
and a god of darkness,
evil, and fear.

414
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,495
Eternally at war.

415
00:25:59,529 --> 00:26:03,532
There are no seven heavens
and no seven hells?

416
00:26:04,834 --> 00:26:07,302
There's only one hell,
Princess.

417
00:26:07,337 --> 00:26:10,506
The one we live in now.

418
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:13,242
<i>( heavy breathing )</i>

419
00:26:37,634 --> 00:26:40,035
<i>( growls )</i>

420
00:26:44,774 --> 00:26:47,709
- <i>Hodor.</i>
- ( breathing heavily )

421
00:26:51,781 --> 00:26:53,015
Why did you wake me?

422
00:26:53,049 --> 00:26:55,984
You've been gone
for hours.

423
00:26:56,019 --> 00:26:57,653
I was hungry.

424
00:26:57,687 --> 00:26:59,755
We're all hungry.

425
00:26:59,789 --> 00:27:01,490
I was just eating.

426
00:27:01,524 --> 00:27:04,560
Summer was eating.

427
00:27:04,627 --> 00:27:07,563
Your body can't live on
the food your wolf consumes.

428
00:27:07,597 --> 00:27:10,732
<i>Spending too much time</i>
<i>in Summer's skin is dangerous.</i>

429
00:27:12,302 --> 00:27:14,102
You're not
a direwolf, Bran.

430
00:27:17,106 --> 00:27:19,041
Must be glorious, though.

431
00:27:19,075 --> 00:27:22,744
To run, to leap,
to hunt.

432
00:27:23,913 --> 00:27:25,747
To be whole.

433
00:27:25,782 --> 00:27:28,550
<i>I know that's tempting,</i>

434
00:27:28,585 --> 00:27:30,852
but if you're trapped
in Summer for too long,

435
00:27:30,887 --> 00:27:32,754
you'll forget what it was
to be human.

436
00:27:36,726 --> 00:27:38,860
You'd forget us, Bran.

437
00:27:38,895 --> 00:27:40,796
You'd forget your mother
and father.

438
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:42,831
You'd forget your brothers
and sisters.

439
00:27:42,865 --> 00:27:44,600
You'd forget Winterfell.

440
00:27:44,634 --> 00:27:46,535
You'd forget you.

441
00:27:46,569 --> 00:27:50,706
And if we lose you,
we lose everything.

442

<i>( bells tolling )</i>

<i>and Joffrey of the Houses</i>
<i>Lannister and Baratheon</i>

462

We have a new queen.

Better her than you.

464
00:31:35,965 --> 00:31:38,900
- Bit much, wouldn't you say?
- It feels proportionate.

465
00:31:38,935 --> 00:31:42,070
- Proportionate to what?
- The expected extravagance.

466
00:31:42,171 --> 00:31:44,539
People who spend their money
on this sort of nonsense

467
00:31:44,574 --> 00:31:46,174
tend not to have it
for long.

468
00:31:46,209 --> 00:31:49,411
You ought to try
enjoying something before you die.

469

You might find
it suits you.

470
00:31:51,047 --> 00:31:54,683
Not now, Mace.
Lord Tywin and I are speaking.

Anyway, I don't know what

I'm paying my share.

your generosity?

475
00:32:02,625 --> 00:32:06,094
No, your heartfelt
thank-you is its own reward.

476
00:32:06,128 --> 00:32:09,097
I would imagine I'd be hearing it
again before long.

477
00:32:09,131 --> 00:32:11,299
Wars are rather expensive.

478
00:32:11,334 --> 00:32:14,336
"The Iron Bank
will have its due."

479
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:17,105
How they love
to remind everyone.

480
00:32:17,139 --> 00:32:19,808
Almost as much as you
Lannisters with your debts.

481
00:32:19,842 --> 00:32:21,810
I'm not worried about
the Iron Bank.

482
00:32:21,844 --> 00:32:24,412
We both know
you're smarter than that.

483
00:32:24,447 --> 00:32:28,550
Come, Tywin, let us
celebrate young love.

484
00:32:30,019 --> 00:32:33,188
- <i>( music playing )</i>
- ( people laughing, chatting )

485
00:32:40,429 --> 00:32:42,264
All taken care of.

486
00:32:42,298 --> 00:32:45,233
- You saw her board the ship?
- Aye, she's on it.

487
00:32:45,268 --> 00:32:47,135
You saw the ship
sail away?

488
00:32:47,169 --> 00:32:50,805
No one knows she's there
but you, me, and Varys.

489
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,741
How do you know?

490
00:32:52,775 --> 00:32:55,310
Because if someone follows
me without an invitation,

491
00:32:55,344 --> 00:32:57,078
I'm the last person
they ever follow.

492
00:32:57,113 --> 00:32:59,214
There's someone
following you?

493
00:33:00,983 --> 00:33:02,617
She's gone.

494
00:33:02,652 --> 00:33:04,986
I know you don't
want to believe it, but she is.

495
00:33:05,021 --> 00:33:08,356
Now, go drink till it
feels like you did the right thing.

496
00:33:14,397 --> 00:33:16,564
Hello.

497
00:33:16,599 --> 00:33:19,100
- Hello.
- Not you.

498
00:33:35,284 --> 00:33:37,385
You look
exquisite, child.

499
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:40,722
The wind has been
at you, though.

500
00:33:40,756 --> 00:33:43,858
I haven't had
the opportunity to tell you

501
00:33:43,893 --> 00:33:46,661
how sorry I was to hear
about your brother.

502
00:33:46,696 --> 00:33:50,231
War is war, but killing a man
at a wedding,

503
00:33:50,266 --> 00:33:51,833
horrid.

504
00:33:51,867 --> 00:33:54,102
What sort of monster
would do such a thing?

505
00:33:54,136 --> 00:33:57,605
As if men need more
reasons to fear marriage.

506
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,140
My lady.
My lady.

507
00:33:59,175 --> 00:34:02,444
Lord Tyrion, you see?
Not as bad as all that.

508
00:34:02,478 --> 00:34:04,145
Perhaps if
your pauper husband

509
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:06,715
were to sell his mule
and his last pair of shoes,

510
00:34:06,749 --> 00:34:10,051
he might be able to afford
to bring you to Highgarden for a visit.

511
00:34:10,086 --> 00:34:13,121
Now that peace has come
and all is right with the world,

512
00:34:13,189 --> 00:34:15,223
it would do you good
to see some of it.

513
00:34:15,257 --> 00:34:18,226
You must excuse me.
It's time I ate

514
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:20,362
some of this food
I paid for.

515
00:34:24,033 --> 00:34:26,901
♪ A coat of gold ♪

516
00:34:26,936 --> 00:34:29,604
♪ Or a coat of red ♪

517
00:34:29,638 --> 00:34:35,510
<i>♪ A lion</i>
<i>still has claws ♪</i>

518
00:34:35,544 --> 00:34:37,979
♪ And mine,
my lord... ♪

519
00:34:38,014 --> 00:34:40,448
Very good. Very good.
Off you go.

520
00:34:40,483 --> 00:34:43,284
- ( coins clatter )
- ( crowd laughs )

521
00:34:57,199 --> 00:34:59,901
My love, why don't we
make the announcement?

522
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:02,437
( taps goblet )

523
00:35:02,471 --> 00:35:04,039
Everyone.

524
00:35:04,073 --> 00:35:07,876
The queen would like
to say a few words.

525
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:11,312
( applause )

526
00:35:15,418 --> 00:35:17,252
We are so fortunate

527
00:35:17,286 --> 00:35:19,521
to enjoy this marvelous
food and drink.

528
00:35:19,555 --> 00:35:22,057
Not all among us
are so lucky.

529
00:35:22,091 --> 00:35:26,027
To thank the gods for bringing
the recent war to a just end,

530
00:35:26,062 --> 00:35:29,364
King Joffrey has decreed
that the leftovers

531
00:35:29,398 --> 00:35:33,101
from our feast be given
to the poorest in his city.

532
00:35:33,135 --> 00:35:36,371
- ( applause )
- <i>( music playing )</i>

533
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:47,015
You're an example
to us all.

534
00:36:03,265 --> 00:36:05,266
Ser Jaime,
I'm very sorry.

535
00:36:05,301 --> 00:36:06,968
Ser Loras,
it's quite all right.

536
00:36:09,772 --> 00:36:11,706
Your sister looks
very beautiful.

537
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:13,274
Loras:
<i>As does yours.</i>

538
00:36:13,309 --> 00:36:16,377
So, looking forward
to your wedding?

539
00:36:16,412 --> 00:36:18,746
Yes, very much.

540
00:36:18,781 --> 00:36:21,149
Our fathers are both
rather keen on the prospect.

541
00:36:21,183 --> 00:36:22,684
They certainly are.

542
00:36:22,718 --> 00:36:23,985
Perhaps they should
get married.

543
00:36:24,019 --> 00:36:26,154
( laughs )

544
00:36:26,188 --> 00:36:28,623
If you were
to marry Cersei,

545
00:36:28,657 --> 00:36:30,258
she'd murder you
in your sleep.

546
00:36:30,292 --> 00:36:33,995
If you somehow managed
to put a child in her first,

547
00:36:34,029 --> 00:36:36,164
she'd murder him, too,

548
00:36:36,198 --> 00:36:37,899
long before he drew
his first breath.

549
00:36:37,933 --> 00:36:41,035
Luckily for you,
none of this will happen

550
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:43,671
because you'll never
marry her.

551
00:36:46,542 --> 00:36:48,643
And neither will you.

552
00:37:02,191 --> 00:37:04,325
Your Grace.
My king.

553
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,227
- My queen.
- Lady Brienne.

554
00:37:06,262 --> 00:37:08,530
So good of you to come.

555
00:37:08,564 --> 00:37:09,998
I'm no lady,
Your Grace.

556
00:37:10,032 --> 00:37:12,433
Did you just bow?

557
00:37:12,468 --> 00:37:13,935
Apologies, Your Grace.

558
00:37:13,969 --> 00:37:16,704
I never did master
the curtsy.

559
00:37:16,739 --> 00:37:18,339
You're the one who put a sword
through Renly Baratheon.

560
00:37:18,374 --> 00:37:21,342
That's not true, my love.
Brienne had nothing to do with it.

561
00:37:21,377 --> 00:37:23,077
A shame.

562
00:37:23,112 --> 00:37:25,747
I'd knight the man that put an end
to that deviant's life.

563
00:37:26,916 --> 00:37:29,050
I just wanted
to congratulate you both

564
00:37:29,084 --> 00:37:30,451
and wish you good fortune.

565
00:37:30,486 --> 00:37:32,387
The country has been
at war too long.

566
00:37:32,421 --> 00:37:35,657
I hope your reign
is long and peaceful.

567
00:37:35,691 --> 00:37:37,492
- Yes, yes.
- Thank you.

568
00:37:37,526 --> 00:37:39,727
I hope we see
more of you.

569
00:37:46,535 --> 00:37:48,570
Lady Brienne.

570
00:37:48,604 --> 00:37:51,439
You're Lord Selwyn
Tarth's daughter.

571
00:37:51,473 --> 00:37:54,442
That makes you a lady
whether you want to be or not.

572
00:37:54,476 --> 00:37:56,744
As you say, Your Grace.

573
00:37:56,779 --> 00:37:58,213
I owe you my gratitude.

574
00:37:58,247 --> 00:38:00,548
You returned my brother
safely to King's Landing.

575
00:38:03,018 --> 00:38:05,386
In truth, he rescued me,
Your Grace.

576
00:38:05,421 --> 00:38:07,155
More than once.

577
00:38:07,189 --> 00:38:09,290
Did he?

578
00:38:10,359 --> 00:38:11,960
Haven't heard
that story before.

579
00:38:13,562 --> 00:38:16,164
Not such a fascinating
story, I'm afraid.

580
00:38:16,198 --> 00:38:18,566
I'm sure you have many
fascinating stories.

581
00:38:18,601 --> 00:38:22,704
Sworn to Renly Baratheon.
Sworn to Catelyn Stark. And now my brother.

582
00:38:22,738 --> 00:38:26,241
Must be exciting to flit
from one camp to the next

583
00:38:26,275 --> 00:38:29,043
serving whichever lord
or lady you fancy.

584
00:38:29,078 --> 00:38:31,613
I don't serve
your brother, Your Grace.

585
00:38:31,647 --> 00:38:33,781
But you love him.

586
00:38:41,824 --> 00:38:43,758
Your Grace.

587
00:38:54,303 --> 00:38:58,339
No, no, come to my chambers
and I will examine you personally.

588
00:38:58,374 --> 00:39:00,642
- She'll do no such thing.
- Oh, Your Grace.

589
00:39:00,676 --> 00:39:02,844
Yes, well, this young
lady sought my advice--

590
00:39:02,878 --> 00:39:04,579
You should see Qyburn.
He's quite good.

591
00:39:04,613 --> 00:39:07,715
- Your Grace.
- Qyburn? Deplorable man.

592
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:11,152
Brought shame on the Citadel with his
repugnant experiments.

593
00:39:11,186 --> 00:39:13,521
More repugnant than
your gnarled fingers on that girl's thighs?

594
00:39:13,555 --> 00:39:15,923
Your Grace,
I am a man of learning.

595
00:39:15,958 --> 00:39:18,760
My little brother had you sent to
the Black Cells when you annoyed him.

596
00:39:18,794 --> 00:39:20,874
What do you think
I could do to you if you annoyed me?

597
00:39:20,896 --> 00:39:22,864
I never meant
to annoy anyone.

598
00:39:22,898 --> 00:39:25,800
But you are.
You annoy me right now.

599
00:39:25,834 --> 00:39:28,002
Every breath you draw
in my presence annoys me.

600
00:39:28,037 --> 00:39:29,537
So here's what I want
you to do.

601
00:39:29,571 --> 00:39:31,105
I want you to leave
my presence.

602
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:32,573
Leave this wedding
right now.

603
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:34,242
Go to the kitchens
and instruct them

604
00:39:34,276 --> 00:39:37,712
that all the leftovers from the feast
will be brought to the kennels.

605
00:39:37,746 --> 00:39:39,981
Your Grace,
Queen Margaery--

606
00:39:40,015 --> 00:39:42,350
The <i>queen</i> is telling you

607
00:39:42,384 --> 00:39:44,652
the leftovers
will feed the dogs

608
00:39:44,687 --> 00:39:46,921
or you will.

609
00:40:05,708 --> 00:40:08,743
A gold dragon to whoever
knocks my fool's hat off.

610
00:40:08,777 --> 00:40:11,012
( crowd laughing )

611
00:40:20,356 --> 00:40:22,557
You're in rather
a good mood.

612
00:40:22,591 --> 00:40:24,892
- I suppose I am.
- I won't ask why.

613
00:40:24,927 --> 00:40:28,129
- Small pleasures.
- Your Grace. Lord Tywin.

614
00:40:28,163 --> 00:40:29,697
Prince Oberyn.

615
00:40:29,732 --> 00:40:31,065
I don't believe you
have met Ellaria.

616
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,834
This is the Lord Hand
Tywin Lannister

617
00:40:32,868 --> 00:40:35,269
and Cersei Lannister
the Queen Regent.

618
00:40:35,304 --> 00:40:38,005
I suppose it is
former Queen Regent now.

619
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:41,442
Lord Hand
and Lady Cersei,

620
00:40:41,477 --> 00:40:45,513
- Ellaria Sand.
- My lord. My lady.

621
00:40:45,515 --> 00:40:47,248
Charmed.

622
00:40:47,282 --> 00:40:49,450
Can't say I've ever
met a Sand before.

623
00:40:53,322 --> 00:40:54,822
We are everywhere in Dorne.

624
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:57,191
I have 10,000 brothers
and sisters.

625
00:40:57,226 --> 00:40:59,660
Bastards are born
of passion, aren't they?

626
00:40:59,695 --> 00:41:01,095
We don't despise them
in Dorne.

627
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:02,330
No?
How tolerant of you.

628
00:41:02,364 --> 00:41:04,399
I expect it is a relief,
Lady Cersei,

629
00:41:04,433 --> 00:41:07,135
giving up your regal
responsibilities.

630
00:41:07,169 --> 00:41:10,304
Wearing the crown for so many years
must have left your neck a bit crooked.

631
00:41:10,339 --> 00:41:12,340
I suppose you'll never
know, Prince Oberyn.

632
00:41:12,374 --> 00:41:14,308
It's a shame your older brother couldn't
attend the wedding.

633
00:41:14,343 --> 00:41:16,677
Please give him
our regards.

634
00:41:16,712 --> 00:41:18,446
With any luck,
the gout will abate

635

with time and he will
be able to walk again.

636

They call it
the rich man's disease.

637
00:41:22,084 --> 00:41:23,451
A wonder
you don't have it.

638
00:41:23,485 --> 00:41:25,353
Noblemen in my part
of the country

639
00:41:25,387 --> 00:41:28,456
don't enjoy the same lifestyle
as our counterparts in Dorne.

640
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:30,358
People everywhere
have their differences.

641
00:41:30,392 --> 00:41:33,594
In some places the highborn
frown upon those of low birth.

642
00:41:33,629 --> 00:41:36,931
In other places the rape and murder
of women and children

643
00:41:36,965 --> 00:41:38,900
is considered distasteful.

644
00:41:40,869 --> 00:41:44,172
What a fortunate
thing for you, former Queen Regent,

645
00:41:44,206 --> 00:41:46,174
that your daughter
Myrcella has been sent

646
00:41:46,208 --> 00:41:48,543
to live in the latter
sort of place.

Clear the floor.

00:41:58,053 --> 00:42:01,823
There's been too much
amusement here today.

650
00:42:01,857 --> 00:42:05,693
A royal wedding
is not an amusement.

651
00:42:05,727 --> 00:42:08,696
A royal wedding
is history.

652
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:11,232
The time has come
for all of us

our history.

Though you're not
the champion yet, are you?

A true champion defeats
all the challengers.

Surely there are

mad with lust.

too cowardly to fight.

Your Grace does me
a great honor.
